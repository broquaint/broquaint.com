      So far on this learning journey through TypeScript I've started a
      Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup game wins follower (<a href="/blog/learning/2024/01/04/learning-and-making.html">part 1</a>, <a href="/blog/learning/2024/01/19/just-some-data.html">part 2</a>)
      and implemented the first 4 steps of <a href="%5Bhttps://github.com/kanaka/mal">Mal</a>
      (<a href="/blog/learning/2024/01/24/mal-for-me.htm">Step 0: the REPL &#x26; Step 1: Read and Print</a>, <a href="/blog/learning/2024/01/29/easy-as-falling-down-stairs.html">Step 2: Eval</a>,
      <a href="/blog/learning/2024/02/09/mapping-out-the-environment.html:">Step 3: Environments</a>). Logically next is more Mal and in this case
      I'm tackling two steps: <a href="https://github.com/kanaka/mal/blob/master/process/guide.md#step-4-if-fn-do">Step 4: If Fn Do</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kanaka/mal/blob/master/process/guide.md#step-5-tail-call-optimization">Step 5: Tail call optimization</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Two steps forward</h2>
    <p>
      The reason I'm covering two steps in this post as that there's not
      much to report in terms of what was learnt. This is quite typical for
      learning a language when implementing Mal—a lot of the learning
      happens on the first few steps, as you familiarize yourself with its
      concepts and facilities, then when you're comfortable with
      the language you can focus on applying that learning to the remaining
      steps.
    </p>
    <h2>Almost control flow analysis</h2>
    <p>
      So in Step 4 one thing that needs implementing is an equality check
      (i.e <code>(= foo bar)</code> test if <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> are equivalent<a href="#equal-rights"><sup>1</sup></a>),
      which is always an interesting part of the implementation as you are
      dealing with both a heterogeneous set of Mal types and also reconciling
      its comparison requirements with how the host language works.
    </p>
    <p>
      A straightforward way of doing this in a lot of languages is to
      match/switch on the Mal type and then compare when the two values
      being compared share a type (otherwise they are necessarily not
      equivalent (with an exception for lists &amp; vectors)). I had hoped it would be as simple a something like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="hljs language-typescript"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(a.<span class="hljs-property">type</span> === b.<span class="hljs-property">type</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">switch</span>(a.<span class="hljs-property">type</span>) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-string">'number'</span>:
            <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> a.<span class="hljs-property">value</span> === <span style="text-decoration: red wavy underline;">b.<span class="hljs-property">value</span></span>
        <span class="hljs-comment">// …</span>
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Which logically speaking should hold—we've asserted that <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>
      have the same <code>type</code> property so are the same type<a href="#be-better"><sup>2</sup></a> and therefore both <em>will</em> have a
      <code>value</code> property. However—as the red squiggly
      indicates, TypeScript doesn't know what to make of <code>b.value</code>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p style="white-space: pre;">Property 'value' does not exist on type 'MalType'.
  Property 'value' does not exist on type 'MalList'.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      So the type checker has enough context in the <code>case</code> branch to know
      that <code>a.value</code> is fine but the control flow analysis from the earlier
      <code>if</code> statement doesn't propagate and hold that <code>b.value</code> must also
      necessarily be fine. The fix was, of course, to just do the comparison
      in the <code>case</code> branch (but it's a <a href="https://github.com/broquaint/mal/blob/my-typescript/impls/ts/core.ts#L76-L104">bit clunky</a> with multiple types).
    </p>
    <p>
      I presume it just isn't supported, rather than being impossible,
      because it's either too uncommon a use case or just complicates the
      control flow analysis enough not to warrant the effort. At any rate it
      was a learning experience!
    </p>
    <h2>It does the job</h2>
    <p>
      The only other thing of note was finding a use for a <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates">type predicate</a>
      to simplify working with <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/sequences">sequence–like</a> types:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="hljs language-typescript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">isMalSeq</span>(<span class="hljs-params">v: MalType</span>): v is <span class="hljs-title class_">MalSeq</span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> v.<span class="hljs-property">type</span> === <span class="hljs-string">'list'</span> || v.<span class="hljs-property">type</span> === <span class="hljs-string">'vector'</span>
}
</code></pre>
    <p>
      That predicate can then make code like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="hljs language-typescript"><span class="hljs-string">'empty?'</span>: mal.<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">(v: MalType) => {
      <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> mal.bool(v.type === <span class="hljs-string">'list'</span> || v.type === <span class="hljs-string">'vector'</span> ? v.values.length === <span class="hljs-number">0</span> : <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>)
      }</span>),</code></pre>
    Into code like this:
    <pre><code class="hljs language-typescript"><span class="hljs-string">'empty?'</span>: mal.<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">(v: MalType) => {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> mal.bool(isMalSeq(v) ? v.values.length === <span class="hljs-number">0</span> : <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>)
}</span>),
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Which is simpler and the intent clearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this is handy it feels awkward as a means of expressing
      a type predicate but I can appreciate that, once again, TypeScript is
      aiming to produce as much unadulterated JavaScript as possible and
      this feature (extending function syntax a little) allows for just
      that. Pragmatic solutions aren't always beautiful solutions but you can't
      argue with the results (I mean you <em>can</em>, but maybe don't do that).
    </p>
    <h2>Returns diminished</h2>
    <p>
      I didn't cover much of the actual Mal implementation as there wasn't much to cover (as it stands it is now Turing complete <em>and</em> has <a href="https://github.com/broquaint/mal/commit/7da28c6ca44765f1f29d585398b94b4c378c41cb">tail–call optimization!</a>). Which brings me on to the conclusion of this series &hellip;
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking ahead to upcoming Mal process steps <a href="https://github.com/kanaka/mal/blob/master/process/guide.md#step-6-files-mutation-and-evil">6</a> through <a href="https://github.com/kanaka/mal/blob/master/process/guide.md#step-a-metadata-self-hosting-and-interop">A</a> I can see that
      the implementation will continue to be an enjoyable exercise but I
      doubt it will require learning a great deal more about TypeScript. So,
      for this blog at least, I'll be ending my fun with Mal in TypeScript
      and switch back to <a href="https://github.com/broquaint/learn-ts-with-dcss">other thing</a> wherein I'm more likely
      to work with more libraries, type definitions and other facets of
      TypeScript.

      <a name="be-better"><sup>2</sup></a> Don't be like me and use the word "type" in
      anything that relates to types, it's a bad idea—you will reach <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation">semantic satiation</a> within moments of beginning any discussion on the matter. I think I can get
      away with it here because this isn't code that others will ever have
      to work with.
