    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
      When trying to learn something new often the hardest problem to solve
      is finding the right questions to ask. Here I sit wanting to create a
      simple web server in TypeScript, in order to have some experience with
      the language, and I'm stumbling at the first hurdle—where do I
      start?
    </p>
    <p>
      Having committed to using Deno, as it supports TypeScript and
      wanting to use it since it was first announced, I'm faced with the
      question of which libraries to use. Do I use a TypeScript first
      library? An existing established JavaScript library and pray for
      straightforward interoperability? I could roll my own but now I'm
      solving an already well solved problem and not starting at the one to
      hand. Instead of equivovating—let's jump in!
    </p>
    <h2>The options</h2>
    <p>
      First up I begin with searching for "deno web server" and find that I
      have the following URL in my history as suggested by Firefox:
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://deno.com/blog/the-future-and-past-is-server-side-rendering"><img src="/assets/img/learning browser memory.png" title="The address bar in Firefox showing a Deno blog post when I start typing 'deno web server'"></a></p>
    <p>
      Well that's a good a place to start as any (you can see my approach is
      very scientific). In their example they use a library called <a href="https://oakserver.github.io/oak/">oak</a>
      which appears to have the <code>.ts</code> TypeScript extension so that's a few
      boxes checked already. Let's see how that goes in practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firstly we grab their stock "Hello, World!" example, stick it in a
      file and see what <code>deno</code> does.
    </p>
    <pre><code>$ pbpaste > server.ts
$ deno run --allow-net server.ts
Warning Implicitly using latest version (v12.6.1) for https://deno.land/x/oak/mod.ts

# In another terminal ...
$ curl http://localhost:8000/
Hello world!
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Excellent, this looks like a good place to start! It seems sometimes
      the best place to start is with your browser history.
    </p>
    <h2>Back to basics</h2>
    <p>
      Ordinarily I would use trusty ol' Emacs for writing code but in this
      instance I'm trying learn new things so it's finally time to use
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Code</a> (what a name!) in anger. Downloading and getting it running
      is fine and Deno also has <a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/references/vscode_deno/">docs specifically for Code</a>. But! It makes the
      classic doc blunder of using one name in the docs, <code>vscode_deno</code>, and
      then not using that same name in the extension itself:
      <p><img src="/assets/img/learning slug not present.png" width="600" title="The Deno docs use 'vscode_deno' but that doesn't appear in the Code extension itself"></p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the first thing I must do is "enable a workspace" which is not a
      concept I currently possess (although I can likely muddle through with
      similar concepts from other editors/runtimes/etc) ... ok following the
      instructions produces an error about a <em>lack</em> of workspace. A few
      steps back are going to be necessary here.
    </p>
    <p>
      An educated guess suggests this is to do with Code, rather than Deno,
      so let's try those docs. Nothing in the top level of the docs ... ok,
      the concept isn't essential or well advertised. In that case let's
      just try stuff in Code ... opening a <em>folder</em> instead of a <em>file</em> has
      allowed the relevant magic to happen. The squiggly red has now
      disappeared and the coding can begin in earnest!
    </p>
    <h2>Actual requirements</h2>
    <p>
      What's really needed is something that fetches the most recent games
      from the various Dungeon Crawl servers. Then something else that
      figures out which are the winning games. Then a final piece to expose
      that information. Sounds like a job for a library! Or at least a
      dedicated <a href="https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/basics/modules/">module</a> as I believe they're called in
      JavaScript-land. Having <a href="https://github.com/broquaint/soup-stash/blob/master/script/keeping-up-with-the-logs">some experience</a> in this area I'm ready to dive
      right in, to writing TypeScript, which is basically JavaScript right?
    </p>
    <p>
      Firstly we need some data to work with so let's what we have to work
      with. The logfiles for the crawl servers are handily <a href="https://github.com/crawl/sequell/blob/master/config/sources.yml">defined already</a>
      so we put together a URL for a nearby server for the latest version
      and see what it looks like:
    </p>
    <pre><code>$ curl -I https://webzook.net/soup/0.30/logfile
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 04 Jan 2024 08:42:05 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.57 (Unix) OpenSSL/3.0.2

ETag: "7d7c1f-60e1a3916919e"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 8223775
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Ok so that's about 8MB which isn't something we want to fetch on a
      regular basis. But let's fetch it once and have a look at the data!
    </p>
    <pre><code>§ wget -O webzook-0.30.logfile https://webzook.net/soup/0.30/logfile

</code></pre>
    <p>
      Super! Some colon–delimited key=value pairs, that should be easy
      enough to work all things being equal. Now does Code provide a REPL
      for poking about with ... it seems like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/typescript">not?</a>. At a glance it
      suggests TypeScript REPLs aren't commonly used, so let's hope there's
      a JavaScript REPL or we'll be running <code>deno</code> from a terminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems the line–based paradigm is out and live coding is in, cool,
      that works too. It looks like <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=achil.vscode-javascript-repl">JavaScript REPL</a> is the extension of
      choice and I'm happy to go with that. It works and is nice but, as my
      first experience of writing code with Code (that name!) shows that the
      editor is a little too eager to flag every little issue the very
      moment it occurs. I believe that can be configured ... bumping up some
      delays makes it seem less aggressive but only marginally. At any rate
      it's working nicely and I can easily build a map that shows what
      happened in the game.

    <p>
      Now we just pull out the field which shows the game ended in a
      win. That field is not technically present in fact. Luckily, as I say,
      I've been here before and <a href="https://github.com/broquaint/soup-stash/blob/master/lib/soupstash/ingestlogfile/transformer.rb#L87C57-L87C77">happen to know</a> that if the <code>tmsg</code> field
      begins <code>escaped with the Orb</code> then it's a winner (these days we
      have a handy <a href="https://github.com/crawl/sequell/blob/master/docs/listgame.md">API doc</a> too!). So know we can filter for winning
      games based on that info, so let's see how many winning games there
      have been for 0.30 on webzook.net.
    </p>
    <h2>Data please</h2>
    <p>
      So we read from the file using a <code>node</code> adjacent API like <code>io</code> right?
      Right? Only if you like <em>deprecated</em> libraries!
    </p>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/learning io deprecated.png" title="The io module docs in Deno where everything looks to be deprecated"> </p>
    <p>
      If I want to do something as innocent as read lines from a file what
      should I be doing?
    </p>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/learning readlines deprecated.png" title="The io.readLines docs in Deno with a big deprecation warning"></p>
    <p>
      It should be a <em>squints suspiciously</em> a <strong>Web</strong> <strong>Streams</strong> API‽ No. No I dont' think so. The sweet embrace of deprecation warnings it is!
    </p>
    <p><img src="/assets/img/learning readlines redlines.png" title="Trying to use the io.readLines and failing"></p>
    <p>
      Apparently not. And even if it were it seems the API is like something
      a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/">90s Java library author</a> <a href="https://deno.land/std@0.210.0/io/mod.ts?s=readLines#Examples">might have written</a> (hey look
      <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#readAllLines-java.nio.file.Path-">slurping all lines at once</a> landed in Java 8!).
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok here I recognize I'm out of my depth and admit defeat, for now, and just pull out an elegant tool for more a
      civilized age:
    </p>
    <pre><code>$ perl -nE '$tot++; $wins++ if /tmsg=escaped with the Orb/ } { say sprintf "%d wins out of a total %d games which is a win percentage of %.2f", $wins, $tot, ($wins / $tot * 100)' webzook-0.30.logfile 
<strong>103</strong> wins out of a total <strong>13485</strong> games which is a win percentage of <strong>0.76</strong>
</code></pre>
    <p>
      That's some nice data and means we have something useful to work with
      (no surprise there!). And here is a good point to call it a day and
      think back on what was learnt.
    </p>
    <h2>Going foreword</h2>
    <p>Today I learnt:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A little about Deno: it mostly just works!
      </li>
      <li>
        A little more about Code: how to create+open a workspace, run some
        TypeScript in situ, configuring some things
      </li>
      <li>
        That the DCSS logfile data is pleasantly stable (little to no change
        in over 10 years!)
      </li>
      <li>
        There are too many static site blogging options (and it's too boring
        to bother blogging about)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      That's a good start! Next I want to be pulling data from a server
      directly and getting a feed of wins.
    </p>
